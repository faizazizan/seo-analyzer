# SEO Analyzer Walkthrough

I have built a modern, fast, and SEO-optimized web application for analyzing URLs.

## Features
- **N-Gram Analysis**: Visualizes 1-gram frequency and lists top 2-gram and 3-gram phrases.
- **Semantic Content Compressor**: Compresses content into 5 levels of brevity using a frequency-based summarization algorithm.
- **On-Page SEO**: Extracts Title, Meta Description, and Headings (H1-H3).
- **Keyword Density**: Calculates word count and identifies top keywords.
- **Modern UI**: Glassmorphism design with dark mode and smooth animations.

## How to Use
1.  Open the application in your browser (running on `http://localhost:3000`).
2.  Enter a URL (e.g., `https://example.com`) in the input field.
3.  Click "Analyze".
4.  View the results in the sections below.

## Verification Results
- **Server**: Running on port 3000.
- **API**: `/api/analyze` successfully fetches and parses HTML.
- **Frontend**: correctly renders data and charts.
